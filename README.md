# Pong
First time SDL2.
Nothing special, just something that helped me to understand how SDL 2.0 works.
Key bindings:
ESC-Quit
R-restart level
A and Left Arrow-left
D and Right Arrow-right
Plans:
In future i'll try to add menu, options, singleplayer and multiplayer online.

I'd appreciate any advices or critique.
